An x3d multiplayer game,
vaguely similar to a game i once enjoyed, 
countless ages ago, on Active Worlds.
It was called mutation, and no one who works there
now seems to remember it.
I remember it, sort of.

I remember the ghost ship, and the docks...
I remember the fishing village and the trade shop...
I remember the gladiators amphitheater...
I remember the lighthouse on the island...
I remember fishing in the rivers and ponds...
I remember the singing stones...
I remember hunting rabbits and tigers...
I remember diamonds forming in the morning like dew...
I remember the temple where I learned how to heal...
I remember the canyon and the high wall temple where i learned to call the wind...
I remember the underground lava pit where I learned the sheild spell.
I remember the demon church where i learned power of blood.
I remember gathering firewood in the forest and learning how to cook fish...
I remember learning to swim in the ocean and finding a lost city there...
I remember the snake pit with its puzzle door, and learning the spell of light...
I remember the mountain temple with the odd drain pipe and the tower of hanoi puzzle...
I remember fighting torak once all the power enhancing jewels were collected...
I remember the high mountain portal that journeyed (us) to his lair...
I remember fighting alongside the other puzzle solvers, (jewel collectors)...
I remember the strange giant, ancient statues with swords...
I remember the houses in the village, the chests to store stuff in...
I remember wishing my character could lie down on the bed...
I remember "ghosting" through glitches in the walls...
I remember looking out through the underground glitch dimension, looking at the reverse side...
I remember generous players teaching me things, and long, strange conversations, typing like blazes.
I remember the walled mountain city with the trade fair and potion shops...
I remember the deserted farm and the ghost that protected the treasure buried there... Daedor
I remember the long swim across the ocean, and the infinite desert on the far shore.
I remember the beautiful bright red trees...
I remember "practicing" to improve the success rate of skills...
I remember gathering "mutis", mutation coins, and finding pearls in the ocean...
I remember the tightrope across the canyon, and the mountain village of log cabins...
I remember the blacksmiths shop and the book i could never open, and the corrall outside.
I remember the diamond in the sky, I made a shield spell, then jumped up on it to try and reach...
I remember other players asking me to "hit them" so they could practice the heal spell...
I remember active worlds, gate world, the pavilion, the waterfall, the crowds that lingered there...
I remember flying and floating and the ring of gates to other worlds...
I remember an incredibly well made, seductive female avatar, and the world with free fish models...
I remember the variety of avatars that came through gateworld...
I remember the bridge app i made that used active worlds, and cortona embedded in AW browser side window...
I remember routing its modeling signals through an online web site... LOL

I wonder if anyone else remembers that place?
