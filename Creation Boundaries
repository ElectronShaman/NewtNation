Will be using x3dom as the player side platform.
All resources combined will weigh less than a gigabyte.
Chat/Text and avatar action signals will be routed through...
... (suggestions,  anyone?)

Player inventory, progress and experience stats will be
stored in cookies.

To increase variety, many models will be mix and match,
auto generated from simpler components.

Very low poly, but not blocky.

Already have a pile of ccby resources from sketchfab.
A lot of code I wrote myself, javascript,
mostly abstracted but some adjustments will be needed
to transition from ancient vrml to x3d.

need a simple landscape loader or generator.
x3dom has built in terrain following.

No deadline, no rush.
This is a project for nostalgic purposes and creative expression.
Code should be kept as small, simple, and obvious as possible.
